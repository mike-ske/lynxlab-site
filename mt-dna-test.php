                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                A mitochondrial DNA test (mtDNA test) traces someone's matrilineal or mother-line ancestry using the DNA in his or her mitochondria. mtDNA is passed down by the mother unchanged, to all her children, both male and female which means this DNA test can therefore be taken by both men and women to determine female lineage relationship. 
                <br><br>
                Female Lineage test, mtDNA comparison DNA test, is mostly used to confirm relationship to long-lost relatives and possible ancestors through the maternal line.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Female Lineage Test provides additional information for situations where maternity is in question, but the mother is unavailable for a maternity test. Although Female Lineage Testing does not determine maternity itself, it can determine the child’s relationship to a possible maternal relative.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Female Lineage Test identifies genetic variations in Mitochondrial DNA of the people involved. It can be used to obtain information about the direct female ancestral line. 
                <br><br>
                Mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA or <a href="http://genetics.ncai.org/types-of-genetic-ancestry-tests.cfm?pdf=1&">Female Lineage testing</a>, can be useful for genealogy because it preserves information about female ancestors that may be lost from the historical record because of the way surnames are often passed down.

                It is mostly for genealogy, ancestry or family history. It goes beyond what can be learnt from 
                relatives or from historical documentation. Female Lineage test, or <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/ancestrytesting">mtDNA test,</a> examines DNA variations which provides clues about where a person's ancestors might have come from and about relationships between different families.
