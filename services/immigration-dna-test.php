                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Immigration DNA test is a DNA test done to provide supplementary evidence of relationship in cases where other documents such as birth certificate and other registered records are not available or do not meet the standard requirement of the immigration department of the destination country.
                <br><br>
                Once DNA testing is completed, we send a strict chain of custody test results and a clear explanation of the results to the immigration authorities and petitioners. Our legal results are accredited by the <a href="https://www.aabb.org/standards-accreditation">American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)</a> and <a href="https://nata.com.au/"> National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA)</a> which meets the requirements of <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/"> United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)</a>  and other immigration agencies.
                <br><br>
                In the absence of the father or mother, there are other DNA tests that can be done to prove 
                biological relationship with the other individual or family for immigration purposes.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Immigration DNA Test is a useful tool for verifying a stated biological relationship when no other form of credible evidence is available in conjunction with an immigrant visa (IV) application. It is the last resort if documents, photos, or birth certificates are unavailable in a timely manner.
                <br><br>
                Commonly tested relationships that utilize Immigration DNA Testing include paternity, maternity, full-siblingship, or half-siblingship.
