                DNA Paternity Test is a painless method used to confirm biological relationship between a presupposed father and the child by using buccal swab samples. At Lynx DNA Laboratory, we run a <a href="https://www.lynxlaboratories.com.ng/">series of tests</a> known as ‘DNA SEQUENCING’ for genetic matches between the alleged father and the child to determine biological relationship. 
                <br><br>
                Our DNA Paternity Test in Nigeria is available at our Lagos office and a network of accredited DNA Test Centers in Calabar, Benin, Port Harcourt, Aba among other states across the country.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body">
                DNA Paternity Test is normally done to legally confirm the real biological father of a child in dispute through genetic profiling of both the child and the alleged father via DNA test. In most cases of dispute over who the true biological father of a child is, <a href="https://www.lynxlaboratories.com.ng/">DNA Paternity Test</a> has helped reach a generally accepted resolution.
                <br><br>
                Paternity test also provides correct medical history of a child which helps healthcare services
                provider with additional insight for managing a child’s health.

                Determining paternity through DNA tests can be important for several reasons. It can help gain legal rights to child support, child custody, social security benefits and inheritance. 
                <br><br>
                Blood typing was the form of parental testing used in the early 90's after scientists discovered that types are inherited genetically. Over time, that has evolved into more sophisticated and more accurate genetic profiling with DNA tests.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Paternity test entails collection of small samples of blood, tissue, or any other body fluid from a child and supposed father, in order to cross-examine their DNAs to determine who is the genuine biological father of the child in dispute. 
                <br><br>
                Sample of cells inside the cheek of a child and the alleged father can also be collected for Paternity Test, although DNA is present in almost every cell or body fluids in the human body

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Paternity Test can be done during pregnancy and after childbirth. Paternity test done after a child is born is called <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/paternity-testing/">postnatal paternity test</a>  and it is done through umbilical cord collection at delivery or collection of the baby's body fluid at a lab. 
                <br><br>
                Prenatal paternity test is done via CVS or <a href="https://www.google.com.ng/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiR86zVgKXWAhUJzRQKHTwQDkwQFgguMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAmniocentesis&usg=AFQjCNEy5eu54BexcAunGBeB7rEVk2dxfA">amniocentesis</a>  with possibility of a miscarriage being carefully considered.
