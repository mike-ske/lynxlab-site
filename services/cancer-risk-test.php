            Genetic cancer risk testing helps determine 
            your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime 
            by searching for specific changes (mutations) in 
            your genes, chromosome, or protein. With only a saliva 
            sample, you can identify your cancer risks by analyzing 
            different genes from your DNA. Take control of your health.

            <p>
                The socio-economic effect of Cancer on our society cannot be overemphasized. The need for early diagnosis is therefore of immense importance in the cost of treatment and overall outcome of cancer management.
                <br>
                Genetic Cancer Risk Test is all about assessing the risk of individuals who is likely to have hereditary cancer. It is particularly advised that the relatives of cancer patients be encouraged to benefit from this test. Other interested patients, especially those on comprehensive medical examination, can also benefit. Genetic cancer risk testing helps determine your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime by searching for specific changes (mutations) in your genes, chromosome, or protein.

                At present, genetic tests are available for these types of 
                cancer:
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Breast cancer</li>

                <li>Colon cancer</li>
                <li>Thyroid cancer</li>
                <li>Prostate cancer</li>

                <li>Stomach cancer</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            <p>

                To achieve an ideal risk assessment, saliva collection is required using a saliva collection kit and sent for analysis. Carefully collected specimen would be preserved and analyzed. Results are expected to be released within 30 business days.

                <b>There are several risk factors that may cause cancers</b>
                
                <br><br>
                The following are factors that suggest a possible increased risk for hereditary cancer

                <br><br>

            </p> 
            <p>
                A genetic cancer test risk will show specific genetic changes, 
                suggest a 
                personal or family history of cancer and the result
                will help with diagnosis / management of a condition. 
                Steps such as medication, frequent screening and lifestyles 
                changes and sometimes early surgery would be taken to lower the risk.
