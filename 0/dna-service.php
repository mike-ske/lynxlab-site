                DNA Paternity test is a painless method used to
                confirm biological relationship between a presupposed
                father and the child by using buccal swab samples. 
                The lab runs series of tests known as 
                ‘DNA SEQUENCING’ for genetic match between 
                the alleged father and the child.
                We offer 3 types of DNA PATERNITY TEST

                inheritance rights, adoption, child support and or other
                 legal reasons.  A strict chain-of-custody is duly followed 
                for a legal test to be accepted.

                NIPP test is performed as early as 10 weeks of conception 
                and is very safe for the mother and the fetus. Blood sample 
                from the mother containing cell-free DNA 
                (cells from the fetus floating freely in the mother’s
                bloodstream) and cheek swab from the father is collected. 

                <br><br>
                The fetal DNA is isolated and analyzed; and then compared to the alleged father.
                NIPP is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.
