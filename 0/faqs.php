                            The inside of the cheek of the tested is gently wiped with a soft cotton swab stick. 
                            Swabbing a cheek is a safe, easy way and less painful to collect the sample 
                            because almost every cell in a person's body contains his or her unique DNA; 
                            it is important to know that DNA in the cheek cells is the same as the DNA in 
                            blood cells and provides 100% information as in the case of blood samples. 
                            Each sample is then sealed in its own envelope, labeled for identification

                            The main difference between a legal test and a peace of mind test is how the results

                            peace of mind test are not. Courts accept results for a legal test because a chain-of-custody
                             process with witnessed DNA collection is followed, which 
                            ensures the correct DNA has been submitted for testing.

                            We use cheek swabs (also called buccal swabs). Cheek

                             containing DNA. This is not a saliva test. Do not spit on the swabs. If they seem very wet, wave swabs in the air for 60 seconds prior to placing them in the paper sample envelopes.

                            Yes! a peace of mind test can be performed without the mother. If the mom cannot, or does not want to be tested, we can still perform a home paternity test. A “motherless” test could require more extensive analysis to produce conclusive results, but the results are just as accurate as those of a standard paternity test with the mother included.

                            Peace of mind test results are accurate for the samples provided to the laboratory. For peace of mind testing, the lab relies on test participants to make sure samples being analyzed by the lab belong to the correct people. If you do not trust other participants’ integrity with submitting correct samples, you can either make sure you’re all together in the same room during swabbing.

                            A main reason to establish paternity while pregnant is
                             to determine the father of a child as early as possible.
                              More complex reasons may include access to legal and social benefits, 
                              establishing accurate medical histories, ensuring the biological father is 
                              involved in the pregnancy, and perhaps simply to strengthen the family bond, particularly 
                              between a father and child.  We’re ready to help.

                             defensible in courts and other government agencies. Many of our clients use their test results for immigration, to obtain child support and for other important legal purposes, such as validating claims for Social Security benefits or inheritances.

                            The chain of custody process is what makes a legal paternity test results legally 
                            defensible in courts and other government agencies. It involves three main aspects:
                            <ul style="list-style: disc;margin-left: 40px;">
                                <li>The tested parties are properly identified when their samples are collected. (Their government-issued IDs are verified and photocopied.)</li>
                                <li>The DNA samples are collected by a neutral third party—someone who has no personal interest in the outcome of the test (e.g., a hospital, clinic, or laboratory staff person).</li>
                                <li>The samples are tamper-taped, securely packaged at the collection site, and carefully inspected.</li>

                            When these requirements are satisfied and documented, the results are legally defensible. This means that the client can use them for legal purposes such as, immigration, child custody, child support, and more.

                            When you arrive at your appointment, you will need to present proper identification, which the sample collector will verify and photocopy.
                            After you are properly identified, you will need to sign a form giving your consent for the test. If you are the legal custodian of a tested minor, you will have to sign the form on behalf of the child.
                            The collector will collect your DNA samples using simple buccal swabs—cotton-like swabs that he or she will rub against the inside of your cheek to gather loose cheek cells. The collector will then send all the samples to the laboratory.
                            Our collection process is designed to be convenient, simple, and painless!

                                    <li>Several first-degree relatives (mother, father, sisters, brothers, children) with cancer.</li>

                                    <li>A cluster of cancers in your family that are known to be linked to a single gene mutation (such as breast, ovarian or pancreatic cancers in your family).</li>
                                    <li>A family member with more than 1 type of cancer.</li>
                                    <li>Family members who had cancer at a younger age than normal for that type of cancer.</li>
                                    <li>Close relatives with cancers that are linked to rare hereditary cancer syndromes.</li>
                                    <li>A family member with a rare cancer, such as breast cancer in a male or retinoblastoma.</li>
                                    <li>A physical finding that’s linked to an inherited cancer (such as having many colon polyps).</li>

                            Before a person should have a genetic test, it is important that he or she fully understands the testing procedure.
                            <br>
                            During testing, the genes are separated from the rest of the DNA, and then they are scanned for abnormalities. Written informed consent is usually obtained before a genetic test is ordered. People give their consent by signing a form saying that they have been told about, and understand, the purpose of the test, its medical implications, its risks and benefits, possible alternatives to the test, and their privacy rights.

                            Your test results may be positive, negative or uncertain.

                            <h5 style="font-weight:600">A positive genetic test result</h5>
                            If you’ve had a positive result, this means you have inherited an altered gene and your chance of developing breast cancer (and possibly other cancers) is far greater than the general population.

                            <h5 style="font-weight:600">A negative genetic test result</h5>
                            If the predictive genetic test shows that you don’t have the altered gene (a negative result), your risk of developing breast cancer is the same as women in general population. 
                             Your test results may be positive, negative or uncertain.
                             <br>
                            Having a negative result also means that any children you have, or may have in the future, won’t inherit an altered gene.
