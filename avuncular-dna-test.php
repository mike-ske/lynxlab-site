                Avuncular DNA test determines if a person is biologically related to a sibling of the father in 
                dispute. This is a good option when the father is not available for testing, and the only relative available is a single sibling (brother or sister) of the father.
                <br><br>
                An Avuncular DNA test, also known as Aunt-Uncle DNA testing, allows the brother or sister of the parent in dispute to participate in a DNA test to verify their biological relationships with an alleged niece or nephew.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Avuncular DNA Test is the most appropriate DNA test for determining either paternal uncle or aunt of the person in dispute. It is used when relatives (generally aunts or uncles) want to know in a way that is scientific whether someone who claims to be their niece and/or nephew is really their blood relative.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Avuncular DNA testing examines specific genetic markers that relate to the aunt-uncle relationship. It analyzes the genetic markers to determine the statistical probability that an individual is the biological aunt or uncle of a child or adult.

                <a href="https://dna-paternity-testing.com/avuncular-dna-test/">Avuncular DNA tests</a>  can work by testing samples from uncle or aunty. But, it is more accurate if the mother's DNA sample is also tested.
