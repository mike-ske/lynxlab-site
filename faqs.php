                            The inside of the cheek of the tested is 
                            gently wiped with a soft cotton swab stick. 
                            Swabbing a cheek is a safe, easy way and less 
                            painful to collect the sample because almost every
                            cell in a person's body contains his or her unique 
                            DNA; it is important to know that DNA in the cheek 
                            cells is the same as the DNA in blood cells and 
                            provides 100% information as in the case of blood 
                            samples. Each sample is then sealed in its own envelope,
                            labeled for identification purposes and sent to our lab 
                            for processing.
