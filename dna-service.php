            <p class="txt_bdy">
                DNA Paternity test is a painless method 
                used to confirm biological relationship 
                between a presupposed father and the child 
                by using buccal swab samples. The lab runs series 
                of tests known as ‘DNA SEQUENCING’ for genetic match 
                the alleged father and the child.
                We offer 3 types of DNA PATERNITY TEST
            </p>

            
            <h3 class="txt_1">Peace of Mind Test</h3>
            <p class="txt_bdy">
                A peace of mind test is used basically for 
                one’s personal interest to ascertain the
                paternity of a child. Results are not court-admissible.

            </p>

            <h3 class="txt_1">Legal DNA Test</h3>
            <p class="txt_bdy">
                A legal paternity test is required when one wants to back 
                all claims legally. It is used as proof of relationship for
                immigration, custody, birth certificate, inheritance rights,
                adoption, child support and or other legal reasons. A strict 
                chain-of-custody is duly 
                followed for a legal test to be accepted.

            </p>

            <h3 class="txt_1">Non-invasive prenatal paternity DNA test</h3>
            <p class="txt_bdy">
                This test focuses more on the baby DNA. It can be used to 
                detect some chromosomal abnormalities and some genetic 
                conditions like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Klinefelter’s 
                syndrome (XXY) and about 16 other abnormalities. 

                <br><br>
                NIPP test is performed as early as 10 weeks of conception 
                and is very safe for the mother and the fetus. Blood sample 
                from the mother containing cell-free DNA 
                (cells from the fetus floating freely in the mother’s
                bloodstream) and cheek swab from the father is collected. 

                <br><br>
                The fetal DNA is isolated and analyzed; and then compared to the alleged father.
                NIPP is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.

                Maternity DNA testing determines whether the tested woman 
                is the biological mother of the tested child. 

                <br>
                A maternity test compares a child’s DNA with the mother's DNA to 
                ascertain the relationship since children inherit half of their DNA 
                from their father, 
                and half from their mother's.
