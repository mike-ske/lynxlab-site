                DNA Paternity test is a painless method used to
                confirm biological relationship between a presupposed
                father and the child by using buccal swab samples. 
                The lab runs series of tests known as 
                ‘DNA SEQUENCING’ for genetic match between 
                the alleged father and the child.
                We offer 3 types of DNA PATERNITY TEST

                A peace of mind test is used basically for one’s personal 
                interest to ascertain the paternity of a child. 
                Results are not court-admissible.

                A legal paternity test is required when one wants to back 
                all claims legally. It is used as proof of 
                relationship for immigration, custody, birth certificate, 
                inheritance rights, adoption, child support and or other
                 legal reasons.  A strict chain-of-custody is duly followed 
                for a legal test to be accepted.

                This test focuses more on the baby DNA. It can be used to 
                detect some chromosomal abnormalities and some genetic 
                conditions like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Klinefelter’s 
                syndrome (XXY) and about 16 other abnormalities.

                NIPP test is performed as early as 10 weeks of conception 
                and is very safe for the mother and the fetus. Blood sample 
                from the mother containing cell-free DNA 
                (cells from the fetus floating freely in the mother’s
                bloodstream) and cheek swab from the father is collected. 

                <br><br>
                The fetal DNA is isolated and analyzed; and then compared to the alleged father.
                NIPP is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.
