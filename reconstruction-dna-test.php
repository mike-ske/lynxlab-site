                Family Reconstruction DNA Test (or genetic reconstruction) is a special paternity test that 
                compares genetic information of a child in dispute with that of two or more relatives who are close to the alleged father.
                <br> <br> 
                Parentage testing when the father is not available can be looked at like a puzzle. There may be relatives we can test—and we most likely need to talk to you about your options. “Family Genetic Reconstruction” can sound intimidating, but one of our friendly DNA experts
                can explain this option on the phone in simple terms.

                 <a href="https://dnacenter.com/relationship-testing/dna-reconstruction/">Family Reconstruction DNA Test</a> becomes inevitable in paternity disputes whereby the alleged father refuses to make a sample of his body fluid available due to personal reasons, incarceration or typical cases where the alleged father is deceased.
                <br><br> 
                A Family Genetic Reconstruction is a series of DNA tests conducted to determine biological 
                family relationships. Most often, it’s used to confirm if a child is related to the father’s 
                close relatives.

                Family Reconstruction DNA Test is tenable evidence in a legal dispute, to acquire for a child inheritance from an estate or other benefits someone is entitled to for being a member of a particular family. 
                <br><br> 
                It is an indirect way to determine family relationships when a potential father is not available for a paternity test. Results of genetic reconstructions can be used to satisfy curiosity, but also may be used as proof in Social Security and other inheritance claims.

                The minimum number of participants in the Family Reconstruction Test in Nigeria is 2. There is no set number of people who need to participate, as each situation is unique and this question is answered on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking, the more close relatives who can take the test, the better!
