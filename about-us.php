            <p class="what_p">
                We use the most proven and advanced methods of DNA testing technology, coupled with credibility of our partners who are accredited by the <a href="http://www.aabb.org/">American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)</a>, the <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov">New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)</a>, the United State Department of Health and Human Service (CLIA) for DNA Parentage testing. 
                <br><br>
                Over the past 16 years, we have been able to resolve many DNA related issues such paternity fraud, forensic investigations, immigration eligibility, family reconstruction (in cases where the alleged fathers were late), maternity and siblingship disputes.

            <p class="sec_txt">
            We use two extremely accurate DNA sample collection techniques, blood and swab, depending
            on the client's preference. Cheek swabbing is a safe, easy way and less painful to collect the sample because almost every cell in a person's body contains his or her unique DNA. 
            <br><br>
            It is important to note that DNA in the cheek cells is the same as the DNA in blood cells and provides 100% information as in the case of blood samples. As such, cheek swab collection works as effectively as blood sample method, though the former is often preferred because it is less painful. 
            <br><br>
            After collection, each sample is then sealed in its own envelope, labeled for identification purposes and sent to our lab for processing.
