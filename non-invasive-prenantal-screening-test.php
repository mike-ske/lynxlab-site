                    A Non-invasive test in prenatal paternity test is the most accurate and safest way to establish paternity in unborn babies. This DNA test requires only blood samples from both parents of the unborn baby. This makes it possible to get accurate answers to paternity questions early during pregnancy without any risk to the baby.
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike outdated methods for determining paternity like amniocentesis or a CVS (Chorionic Villus Sampling) test that can cause a miscarriage, a prenatal DNA is completely non-invasive and safe for both mother and fetus.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                    We do DNA analysis using blood collected from a pregnant woman. Cells from the developing fetus float freely in the bloodstream of the pregnant mother. 
                    <br><br>
                    Non-invasive Prenatal Paternity DNA testing is based on <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/paternity-tests/non-invasive-prenatal-paternity-test/">comparison of genetic</a> profiles of the fetal cells, mother's blood and samples from the father(s) in dispute. It is relatively inexpensive in comparison to invasive techniques such as CVS or amniocentesis.
                    <br><br>
                    The test analyzes free-floating fetal DNA from the mother’s plasma and compares it to the mother’s own DNA profile. Once the fetus’s profile is determined, that profile is then compared to the possible father’s and paternity can be determined

                    Non-invasive Prenatal Paternity DNA test can be performed as early as the 7th week of pregnancy. This is possible because scientifically, fetal cells can be found floating freely in a pregnant woman's blood as early as the 8th week of pregnancy. 
                    <br><br>
                    And as such, paternity of the unborn child can be determined using Non-Invasive Prenatal Paternity Test at this stage.
