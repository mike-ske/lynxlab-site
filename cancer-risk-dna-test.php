                    Cancer Risk DNA Test helps estimate your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime by analyzing your DNA. It does this by searching for specific changes in your genes, chromosomes, or proteins. These changes in DNA are  often called genetic mutations. 
                    <br><br>
                    This genetic test does not categorically declare if someone is a cancer patient, but it can clearly tell your chances of developing it based on certain mutations in your gene.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Living with cancer is a nightmare! Every day is a battle to stay alive. The Union for International Cancer Control has made us understand that in every 3 minutes, 1 person dies from cancer. Not all cancers form tumors (visible growths) on the body and cancers can be present for months or years without being detected.
                <br><br>
                Cancerous cells do not just form, they form over time and this is why individuals should take the cancer risk test. Cancer risk DNA test is a “predictive test” because it determines if an individual has an increased risk of developing cancer even in years to come.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                If a person has an error in a DNA repair gene, mistakes remain uncorrected. Then, the mistakes become mutations. These mutations may eventually lead to cancer, particularly mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Mutations in DNA repair genes may be inherited or acquired.
                <br><br>
                In recent years, 3 types of gene (ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) have been discovered to be prone to cancer. These genes may increase one's risk of developing several types of cancer which include breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, and pancreatic.
                <br><br>
                Cancer Risk Tests are done on cells contained in a blood sample taken from your body. It can also be conducted on saliva (spit), cheek cells (from swabbing the inside of your mouth) and other body tissues.
