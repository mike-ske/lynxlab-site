                Siblingship DNA Test is a reliable testing option for confirming half or full biological siblings. This
                is great for family relationship purposes. It uses standard genetic markers to determine statistical probability of two or more people being full or half brothers  (or sisters, as the case might be). 
                <br> 
                There are industry-wide <a href="https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=86">genetic</a>  markers used as sibling markers for determining siblingship among children in a family. The accuracy of Sibling DNA depends largely on these genetic markers.

                Siblingship DNA Testing is used to determine if a child truly belongs to a particular family; in cases where the father is not available (or deceased) for the standard Paternity test.  It is also widely used to determine <a href="https://adoption.com/forums/thread/371167/full-siblings-vs-half-siblings-question-i-am-curious/">full or half</a>  sibling relationships and comes in handy when someone claims to be a member of your family but there are no real proofs to support such a claim.

                In a siblingship DNA testing at Lynx DNA Laboratory, we analyze the DNA sample collected to calculate a siblingship index. If the siblingship index is less than 1.00, this indicates non-relatedness. If the siblingship index is greater than 1.00, this indicates that the two tested individuals are more likely to be a true full sibling or half-siblings
