                <p class="txt_bdy">
                DNA tests help you answer a lot of questions about how you are wired. Based on your genetic makeup, they can confirm if you have or don't have certain diseases. Apart from paternity frauds, immigration requirements and forensic investigations that are typically synonymous with DNA tests, they can determine if you have a higher risk of developing certain health conditions or carry a specific mutated gene that can be passed to your children.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body">
                    DNA testing is a science, so it is important you understand how it works when you are required to do one. The process comprises DNA sample collection, analysis of your blood or cheek swab sample at a certified DNA test laboratory that uses specialized machinery and delivery of the DNA test results to you with utmost confidentiality. 
                    <br><br>
                    We use the most globally accepted and advanced DNA testing methods, coupled with credibility of our partners who are accredited by the <a href="http://www.aabb.org/">American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)</a>  and the <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov">New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)</a> , to deliver accurate, affordable DNA test services to Nigerians wherever they are located without having to travel around.

                    In order to precisely identify and document the person taking our DNA test services in Nigeria, every client needs to provide any of the following at the point of DNA test sample collection:
                   
                    <ul style="margin-top: 8px;line-height:1.5;list-style:inside;border:none">

                        <li style="line-height:1.5">State issued ID</li>
                        <li style="line-height:1.5">Driver’s License</li>
                        <li style="line-height:1.5">Birth certificate for the child</li>

                </p>
                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                    A photograph is taken of each tested person at the time of sample collection to further ensure the correct and accurate identification of the individual being tested.
                    <br><br>
                    Each tested person signs an agreement with <a href="http://www.lynxlaboratories.com.ng/"> Lynx DNA Laboratory</a> that they observed the labeling of their sample and the information on the sample is true and correct. Samples are immediately sealed in a tamper proof manner. We ensure that a strict chain of custody is followed during shipment and processing of samples.

                <p class="txt_bdy tag_body2">
                Results from our partners in the USA will be available within 48 hours after receiving samples.
                For our Nigerian clients, it will take 14 working days. Remember there are many facts that can affect the timing of the DNA test results but be rest assured that under no circumstance will we ever sacrifice quality.
                <br><br>
                DNA test results are mailed to your office as all tested and / or their designated representatives, unless otherwise instructed by court order.
                <br><br>
                In cases of adoption, the results are released to the adoption agency or its designee. We can also fax the results to a designated legal or medical representative upon request. We do not release results over the telephone to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
