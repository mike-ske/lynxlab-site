            DNA Paternity test is a painless method used to confirm biological relationship between a presupposed father and the child by using buccal swab samples. The lab runs series of tests known as ‘DNA SEQUENCING’ for genetic match between the alleged father and the child.

                A peace of mind test is used basically for one’s personal interest to ascertain the paternity of a child. Results are not court-admissible. The samples can be collected from the comfort of your home. Once your kit arrives, you swab all test participants in the comfort of your home—no visit to a Lab required. Then seal the sample envelopes and send them off to our lab. It’s that simple! The report can be picked from the Lab or send to your mail as directed by the tested

                A prenatal paternity test is the most accurate way to establish paternity in unborn babies. The test analyses the babies cell free floating DNA in the mother’s bloodstream; this is isolated from the mother’s blood and compared to the alleged father’s DNA. Paternity testing can be done as performed as early as 10 weeks of conception and is completely safe for both mother and unborn child. A prenatal paternity test provides answers to questions about paternity dispute of a fetus.
